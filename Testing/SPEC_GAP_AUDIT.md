### Low Priority (>90% spec coverage)

- **Hardware** (Hardware) - 100.0% coverage - 4 parts
- **Shafts & Hubs** (Shafts & Hubs) - 100.0% coverage - 37 parts


## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Days 1-2)
Focus on categories with 0-30% coverage where specs are essential for part selection:

1. **BEAR (Bearings)** - ID/OD/WD dimensions are critical for mechanical fit
2. **WIRE (Wiring)** - Gauge and length are essential for electrical work
3. **BELT (Belts)** - Tooth count and width needed for drivetrain design

### Phase 2: Important Improvements (Days 3-4)
Categories with 30-70% coverage that need better extraction:

4. **FAST (Fasteners)** - Size and length extraction improvements
5. **PULLEY (Pulleys)** - Tooth count and bore extraction
6. **CHAIN (Chain)** - Pitch and length standardization
7. **SPKT (Sprockets)** - Tooth count and pitch verification

### Phase 3: Verification (Day 5)
Validate categories claiming high coverage:

8. **SHAFT** - Verify claimed 100% coverage accuracy
9. **STRUCT** - Verify claimed 93.8% coverage accuracy
10. **GEAR** - Check extraction quality and consistency

### Phase 4: Small Categories (Day 6)
Manual review of low-volume categories:

11. **HDWR** - 4 parts - manual entry
12. **CTRL** - 5 parts - manual entry
13. **ELEC** - 3 parts - manual entry
14. **SENSOR** - 1 part - manual entry

## Testing Checklist

For each category requiring fixes:

- [ ] BEAR - Test on 10 sample parts with ID/OD/WD patterns
- [ ] WIRE - Test gauge and length extraction on 5 parts
- [ ] BELT - Test tooth count and width extraction on 8 parts
- [ ] FAST - Test size and length extraction on 10 parts
- [ ] PULLEY - Verify tooth/bore extraction on 5 parts
- [ ] CHAIN - Test pitch and length extraction on 5 parts
- [ ] SPKT - Verify tooth/pitch extraction on 5 parts
- [ ] GEAR - Sample 10 parts for quality check
- [ ] SHAFT - Sample 5 parts to verify claimed coverage
- [ ] STRUCT - Sample 5 parts to verify claimed coverage

### Validation Criteria

For each fix:
- Extract specs from 90%+ of parts in category
- Specs must match expected format and units
- No data loss from original part names
- All units preserved correctly (", mm, AWG, etc.)
- Handle edge cases (missing data, unusual formats)
- Maintain consistency across similar parts

## Implementation Notes

### Regex Best Practices
- Use case-insensitive matching where appropriate
- Account for variations (ID, id, Id)
- Handle optional quotes and spaces
- Capture units with values
- Use non-greedy matching for parentheses

### Testing Approach
1. Run extraction on full category
2. Sample 10% of results randomly
3. Manual verification of sampled results
4. Check edge cases (first, last, unusual names)
5. Verify no regressions on already-working categories

### Quality Metrics
- Target: 90%+ extraction rate per category
- Acceptable: 85-89% for complex patterns
- Requires manual review: <85%
- Perfect extraction not expected due to data variations
